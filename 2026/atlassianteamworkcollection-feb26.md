## Beyond Deterministic PM- Why AI Products Break Traditional SDLC by [Aman Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amansharma14)

- Deterministic means following a track; Probabilistic means reaching the solution but not following a specific track.

- Instead of following the traditional SDLC for Probabilistic Developments, we need to follow an AI-native development loop.

- In an AI-native development loop, we need to define intent + unknowns first, then measure with signals (not the opinions). Post that, the evaluation of model should be done statistically. Even after that we need to keep monitoring drift in production and then refine continuously.

- The SPIRAL method by Atlassian stands for Scope, Profile, Instrument, Release, Adapt and Learn.

- Starting with Scope, we need to scope the uncertainty and limit the context so that the model does exactly what we're expecting. The confidence should be high in order to have integrity in our solution.

- Next is Profile Success which means, we need to understand the success signal indicators and choose accordingly. With it, we need to define performance bands and fallback triggers to make sure we make the solution more robust.

- Next as said Instrumentation is one of the most important thing to do, we need to monitor the solution, have feedback loops in between and prepare drift detection from day 1 continuously. To track the metrics, we need to log everything from A to Z for future improvements.

- Release is the next crucial thing. We need to ensure that we always do a graduated rollout (controlled), we need to have confidence thresholds and safe fallbacks. The important guardrail we need to have is a Kill switch and escalation path so that we have plug it out if something goes off-path.

- Post that, we need to Adapt systematically for which we can have weekly evaluation cadence, prioritize top failure modes and tune retrieval/ranking/prompt/thresholds to ensure the results are always as expected.

- With it, we have to keep learning as we move forward, here comes the Learn Forward approach. We need to improve by having relavant documentation and keep on improving the product as we move ahead in time. 

- Before building an AI Product, make sure you understand what is good for the model and what is not.
